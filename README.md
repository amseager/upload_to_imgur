Script that allows you to quickly upload pictures to imgur.com.

Simply Run "create_sendto_shortcut.bat" once.

Now you'll be able to select one or multiple files, perform right-click and choose "SendTo" -> "Imgur" to upload your images.

Check the balloon notofication in tray. When the script passes, you'll get a direct link to your uploaded image (or album of multiple images) in clipboard.
