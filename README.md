Script that allows you to quickly upload pictures to imgur.com.

Take the existant "Upload to Imgur" shortcut (or make your own for "launcher.bat") and copy it to "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo" directory (you can also type "shell:sendto" in explorer adress bar to open it).

When the script passes, you will have a direct link to your uploaded image in the clipboard.
